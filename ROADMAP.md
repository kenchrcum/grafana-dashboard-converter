## 🔧 High Priority (P1) - Should Fix

### Code Quality & Architecture

#### 4. Code Modularization
- **Issue**: Single large `main.py` file (425 lines) with mixed responsibilities
- **Impact**: Difficult to maintain, test, and extend
- **Solution**:
  - Extract business logic into separate modules:
    - `converter/` - Core conversion logic
    - `kubernetes/` - K8s API interactions
    - `grafana/` - Grafana-specific utilities
    - `validation/` - Input validation
  - Implement dependency injection for better testability
- **Complexity**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks

#### 5. Comprehensive Testing Suite
- **Issue**: No unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests
- **Impact**: Difficult to ensure reliability and catch regressions
- **Solution**:
  - Add unit tests for all core functions (80%+ coverage)
  - Integration tests for Kubernetes API interactions
  - End-to-end tests with test Kubernetes cluster
  - Performance and load tests
- **Complexity**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks

#### 6. Type Safety & Documentation
- **Issue**: Missing type hints, incomplete docstrings
- **Impact**: Poor IDE support, difficult to understand interfaces
- **Solution**:
  - Add comprehensive type hints throughout codebase
  - Generate API documentation from docstrings
  - Add inline comments for complex logic
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days

### Monitoring & Observability

#### 7. Metrics & Monitoring Integration
- **Issue**: No metrics collection or monitoring capabilities
- **Impact**: Difficult to monitor performance and troubleshoot issues
- **Solution**:
  - Add Prometheus metrics endpoint (`/metrics`)
  - Track conversion success/failure rates
  - Monitor processing latency and throughput
  - Add structured logging with correlation IDs
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Effort**: 1 week

#### 8. Health Check Enhancements
- **Issue**: Basic health checks don't validate core functionality
- **Impact**: May appear healthy while unable to perform conversions
- **Solution**:
  - Add deep health checks (K8s API connectivity, CRD availability)
  - Implement readiness probes that verify conversion capability
  - Add configurable health check endpoints
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

- **Solution**:
  - Implement configuration validation and hot-reloading
  - Add configuration drift detection
  - Support for external configuration sources (ConfigMaps, Secrets)
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Estimated Effort**: 1 week

#### 13. Deployment & Operations
